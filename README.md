[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/CUNY-CL/yoyodyne/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/CUNY-CL/yoyodyne/tree/master)

Yoyodyne provides small-vocabulary sequence-to-sequence generation with and
without feature conditioning.

These models are implemented using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and
[Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/).

## Philosophy

Yoyodyne is inspired by [FairSeq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq)
(Ott et al.Â 2019) but differs on several key points of design:

-   It is for small-vocabulary sequence-to-sequence generation, and therefore
    includes no affordances for machine translation or language modeling.
    Because of this:
    -   The architectures provided are intended to be reasonably exhaustive.
    -   There is little need for data preprocessing; it works with TSV files.
-   It has support for using features to condition decoding, with
    architecture-specific code for handling feature information.
-   It supports the use of validation accuracy (not loss) for model selection
    and early stopping.
-   Models are specified using YAML configuration files.
-   Releases are made regularly and bugs addressed.
-   ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§: It has exhaustive test suites.
-   ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§: It has performance benchmarks.

## Authors

Yoyodyne was created by [Adam Wiemerslage](https://adamits.github.io/), [Kyle
Gorman](https://wellformedness.com/), Travis M. Bartley, and [other
contributors](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/yoyodyne/graphs/contributors) like
yourself.

## Installation

### Local installation

To install Yoyodyne and its dependencies, run the following command:

    pip install .

Then, optionally install additional dependencies for developers and testers:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Google Colab

Yoyodyne is also compatible with [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) GPU runtimes.

1.  Click "Runtime" \> "Change Runtime Type".
2.  In the dialogue box, under the "Hardware accelerator" dropdown box, select
    "GPU", then click "Save".
3.  You may be prompted to delete the old runtime. Do so if you wish.
4.  Then install and run using the `!` as a prefix to shell commands.

## File formats

Other than YAML configuration files, Yoyodyne operates on basic tab-separated
values (TSV) data files. The user can specify source, features, and target
columns, and separators used to parse them.

### Data format

The default data format is a two-column TSV file in which the first column is
the source string and the second the target string.

    source   target

To enable the use of a features column, one specifies a (non-zero)
`data: features_col:` argument, and optionally also a `data: features_sep:`
argument (the default features separator is ";"). For instance, for the
[SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task](https://sigmorphon.github.io/sharedtasks/2016/)
data:

    source   feat1,feat2,...    target

the format is specified as:

    ...
    data:
        ...
        features_col: 2
        features_sep: ,
        target_col: 3
        ...

Alternatively, for the [CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 shared
task](https://sigmorphon.github.io/sharedtasks/2017/), the first column is the
source (a lemma), the second is the target (the inflection), and the third
contains semi-colon delimited features strings:

    source   target    feat1;feat2;...

the format is specified as simply:

    ...
    data:
        ...
        features_col: 3

### Reserved symbols

Yoyodyne reserves symbols of the form `<...>` for internal use.
Feature-conditioned models also use `[...]` to avoid clashes between features
symbols and source and target symbols, and in some cases, `{...}` to avoid
clashes between source and target symbols. Therefore, users should not provide
any symbols of the form `<...>`, `[...]`, or `{...}`.

## Usage

The `yoyodyne` command-line tool uses a subcommand interface, with four
different modes. To see a full set of options available for each subcommand, use
the `--print_config` flag. For example:

    yoyodyne fit --print_config

will show all configuration options (and their default values) for the `fit`
subcommand.

For more detailed examples, see the [`configs`](configs) directory.

### Training (`fit`)

In `fit` mode, one trains a Yoyodyne model, either from scratch or, optionally,
resuming for a prexisting checkpoint. Naturally, most configuration options need
to be set at training time. E.g., it is not possible to switch modules after
training a model.

This mode is invoked using the `fit` subcommand, like so.

    yoyodyne fit --config path/to/config.yaml

Alternatively, one can resume training from a pre-existing checkpoint so long as
it matches the specification of the configuration file.

    yoyodyne fit --config path/to/config.yaml --ckpt path/to/checkpoint.ckpt

#### Seeding

Setting the `seed_everything:` argument to some fixed value ensures a
reproducible experiment (modulo hardware non-determism).

#### Model architecture

A specification for a model includes specification of the overall architecture
and the source encoder; one may also specify a separate features encoder or use
`model: features_encoder: true` to indicate that the source encoder should also
be used for features.

Each model exposes its own hyperparameters; consult the [example configuration
files](configs) and model docstrings for more information.

The following are general-purpose models.

-   `yoyodyne.models.AttentiveGRUModel`: a GRU decoder with an attention
    mechanism; the initial hidden state is treated as a learned parameter. This
    is most commonly used with `yoyodyne.models.modules.GRUEncoder`s.
-   `yoyodyne.models.AttentiveLSTMModel`: an LSTM decoder with an attention
    mechanism; the initial hidden and cell state are treated as learned
    parameters. This is most commonly used with
    `yoyodyne.models.modules.LSTMEncoder`s.
-   `yoyodyne.models.TransformerModel`: a transformer decoder; sinusodial
    positional encodings and layer normalization are used. This is most commonly
    used with `yoyodyne.models.modules.TransformerEncoder`s.

The following models are appropriate for when source and target share symbols.

-   `yoyodyne.models.PointerGeneratorGRUModel`: a GRU decoder with a
    pointer-generator mechanism; the initial hidden state is treated as a
    learned parameter. This is most commonly used with
    `yoyodyne.models.modules.GRUEncoder`s.
-   `yoyodyne.models.PointerGeneratorLSTMModel`: an LSTM decoder with a
    pointer-generator mechanism; the initial hidden and cell state are treated
    as learned parameters. This is most commonly used with
    `yoyodyne.models.modules.LSTMEncoder`s.
-   `yoyodyne.models.PointerGeneratorTransformerModel`: a transformer decoder
    with a pointer-generator mechanism. This is most commonly used with
    `yoyodyne.models.modules.TransformerEncoder`s.

The following models are appropriate for transductions which are largely
monotonic.

-   `yoyodyne.models.HardAttentionGRUModel`: an GRU decoder which models
    generation as a Markov process. By default it assumes a non-monotonic
    progression over the source, but with `model: enforce_monotonic: true` the
    model is made to progress over each source character in linear order. By
    specifying `model: attention_context: 1` (or larger values) one can widen
    the context window for state transitions. This is most commonly used with
    `yoyodyne.models.modules.GRUEncoder`s.
-   `yoyodyne.models.HardAttentionLSTMModel`: an LSTM decoder which models
    generation as a Markov process. By default it assumes a non-monotonic
    progression over the source, but with `model: enforce_monotonic: true` the
    model is made to progress over each source character in linear order. By
    specifying `model: attention_context: 1` (or larger values) one can widen
    the context window for state transitions. This is most commonly used with
    `yoyodyne.models.modules.LSTMEncoder`s.

The following models are also appropriate for transductions which are largely
monotonic, but require additional precomputation with the
[`maxwell`](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/maxwell/tree/main) library. With these,
one is recommended to use `trainer: accelerator: cpu` as they are not optimized
for GPU (etc.) acceleration.

-   `yoyodyne.models.TransducerGRU`: an LSTM decoder with a neural transducer
    mechanism trained with imitation learning. This is most commonly used with
    `yoyodyne.models.modules.LSTMEncoder`s.
-   `yoyodyne.models.TransducerLSTM`: an LSTM decoder with a neural transducer
    mechanism trained with imitation learning. This is most commonly used with
    `yoyodyne.models.modules.LSTMEncoder`s.

The following models are not recommended for most users. They generally perform
poorly and are present only for historical reasons.

-   `yoyodyne.models.GRUModel`: a GRU decoder which uses the last non-padding
    hidden state(s) of the encoder(s) in lieu of attention; the initial hidden
    state is treated as a learned parameter. This is most commonly used with
    `yoyodyne.models.modules.GRUEncoder`s.
-   `yoyodyne.models.LSTMModel`: a LSTM decoder which uses the last non-padding
    hidden state(s) of the encoder(s) in lieu of attention; the initial hidden
    state is treated as a learned parameter. This is most commonly used with
    `yoyodyne.models.modules.LSTMEncoder`s.

#### Optimization

Yoyodyne requires an optimizer and an learning rate scheduler. The default
optimizer is
[`torch.optim.Adam`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.Adam.html),
and the default scheduler is `yoyodyne.schedulers.Dummy`, which keeps learning
rate fixed at its initial value and takes no explicit configuration arguments.

The following YAML snippet shows the use of the Adam optimizer with a
non-default initial learning rate and the
`yoyodyne.schedulers.WarmupInverseSquareRoot` LR scheduler:

    ...
    model:
        ...
        optimizer:
          class_path: torch.optim.Adam
          init_args:
            lr: 1.0e-5 
        scheduler:
          class_path: yoyodyne.schedulers.WarmupInverseSquareRoot
          init_args:
            warmup_epochs: 10   
        ...

#### Checkpointing

The
[`ModelCheckpoint`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint.html)
is used to control the generation of checkpoint files. A sample YAML snippet is
given below.

    ...
    checkpoint:
      filename: "model-{epoch:03d}-{val_accuracy:.4f}"
      mode: max
      monitor: val_accuracy
      verbose: true
      ...

Alternatively, one can specify a checkpointing that minimizes validation loss,
as follows.

    ...
    checkpoint:
      filename: "model-{epoch:03d}-{val_loss:.4f}"
      mode: min
      monitor: val_loss
      verbose: true
      ...

A checkpoint config must be specified or Yoyodyne will not generate any
checkpoints.

#### Callbacks

The user will likely want to configure additional callbacks. Some useful
examples are given below.

The
[`LearningRateMonitor`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.callbacks.LearningRateMonitor.html)
callback records learning rates:

    ...
    trainer:
      callbacks:
      - class_path: lightning.pytorch.callbacks.LearningRateMonitor
        init_args:
          logging_interval: epoch
      ...

The
[`EarlyStopping`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/early_stopping.html)
callback enables early stopping based on a monitored quantity and a fixed
`patience`:

    ...
    trainer:
      callbacks:
      - class_path: lightning.pytorch.callbacks.EarlyStopping
        init_args:
          monitor: val_loss
          patience: 10
          verbose: true
      ...

#### Logging

By default, Yoyodyne performs some minimal logging to standard error and uses
progress bars to keep track of progress during each epoch. However, one can
enable additional logging faculties during training, using a similar syntax to
the one we saw above for callbacks.

The
[`CSVLogger`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/extensions/generated/lightning.pytorch.loggers.CSVLogger.html)
is enabled by default, and logs all monitored quantities to a CSV file.

The
[`WandbLogger`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/extensions/generated/lightning.pytorch.loggers.WandbLogger.html)
works similarly to the `CSVLogger`, but sends the data to the third-party
website [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site), where it can be used to
generate charts or share artifacts:

    ...
    trainer:
      logger:
      - class_path: lightning.pytorch.loggers.WandbLogger
        init_args:
          project: unit1
          save_dir: /Users/Shinji/models
      ...

Note that this functionality requires a working account with Weights & Biases.

#### Other options

Dropout probability and/or label smoothing are specified as arguments to the
`model` and its encoders:

    ...
    model:
      source_encoder:
        class_path: ...
        init_args: ...
          dropout: 0.5
      decoder_dropout: 0.5
      label_smoothing: 0.1
      ...

Batch size is specified using `data: batch_size: ...` and defaults to 32.

By default, the source and target vocabularies share embeddings so identical
source and target symbols will have the same embedding. This can be disabled
with `data: tie_embeddings: false`.

By default, training uses 32-bit precision. However, the `trainer.: precision:`
flag allows the user to perform training with half precision (`16`), or with
mixed-precision formats like `bf16-mixed` if supported by the accelerator. This
might reduce the size of the model and batches in memory, allowing one to use
larger batches, or it may simply provide small speed-ups.

There are a number of ways to specify how long a model should train for. For
example, the following YAML snippet specifies that training should run for 100
epochs or 6 wall-clock hours, whichever comes first:

    ...
    trainer:
      max_epochs: 100
      max_time: 00:06:00:00
      ...

### Validation (`validate`)

In `validation` mode, one runs the validation step over labeled validation data
(specified as `data: val: path/to/validation.tsv`) using a previously trained
checkpoint (`--ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt` from the command line),
recording loss and other statistics for the validation set. In practice this is
mostly useful for debugging.

This mode is invoked using the `validate` subcommand, like so:

    yoyodyne validate --config path/to/config.yaml --ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt

### Evaluation (`test`)

In `test` mode, one computes accuracy over held-out test data (specified as
`data: test: path/to/test.tsv`) using a previously trained checkpoint
(`--ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt` from the command line); it differs from
validation mode in that it uses the `test` file rather than the `val` file.

This mode is invoked using the `test` subcommand, like so:

    yoyodyne test --config path/to/config.yaml --ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt

#### Inference (`predict`)

In `predict` mode, a previously trained model checkpoint
(`--ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt` from the command line) is used to label
an input file. One must also specify the path where the predictions will be
written:

    ...
    predict:
      path: /Users/Shinji/predictions.txt
    ...

This mode is invoked using the `predict` subcommand, like so:

    yoyodyne predict --config path/to/config.yaml --ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt

Vanilla RNN models (like `yoyodyne.models.AttentiveGRUModel` or
`yoyodyne.models.AttentiveLSTMModel`) and pointer-generator RNN models (like
`yoyodyne.models.PointerGeneratorGRUModel` or
`yoyodyne.models.PointerGeneratorLSTMModel`) support beam search during
prediction. This is enabled by setting a `beam_width` \> 1, but also requires a
`batch_size` of 1:

    data:
      ...
      batch_size: 1
      ...
    model:
      class_path: yoyodyne.models.AttentiveLSTMModel
      init_args:
        ...
        beam_width: 5
        ...
    predict:
      path: /Users/Shinji/predictions.tsv
      ...

The resulting prediction files will be a 10-column TSV file consisting of the
top 5 target hypotheses and their log-likelihoods (collated together), rather
than single-file text files just containing the top hypothesis.

## Examples

The [`examples`](examples) directory contains interesting examples, including:

-   [`concatenate`](examples/concatenate) provides sample code for concatenating
    source and features symbols Ã  la Kann & SchÃ¼tze (2016).
-   [`wandb_sweeps`](examples/wandb_sweeps) shows how to use [Weights &
    Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) to run hyperparameter sweeps.

## Related projects

-   [Maxwell](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/maxwell) is used to learn a stochastic
    edit distance model for the transducer models.
-   [Yoyodyne Pretrained](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/yoyodyne-pretrained)
    provides a similar interface but uses large pre-trained models to initialize
    the encoder and decoder modules.

### License

Yoyodyne is distributed under an [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE.txt).

## For developers

We welcome contributions using the fork-and-pull model.

### Older versions

In addition to releases available via
[GitHub](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/yoyodyne/releases) and
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/yoyodyne/), the 0.3.3 version is available as
[the `legacy` branch](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/yoyodyne/tree/legacy).

### Design

Yoyodyne is beholden to the heavily object-oriented design of Lightning, and
wherever possible uses Torch to keep computations on the user-selected
accelerator. Furthermore, since it is developed at "low-intensity" by a
geographically-dispersed team, consistency is particularly important. Some
consistency decisions made thus far:

-   Abstract classes overrides are enforced using [PEP
    3119](https://peps.python.org/pep-3119/).
-   [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) is used for basic mathematical operations and
    constants even in places where the built-in
    [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) would do.

#### Models and modules

A *model* in Yoyodyne is a sequence-to-sequence architecture and inherits from
`yoyodyne.models.BaseModel`. These models in turn consist of ("have-a") one or
more *encoders* responsible for encoding the source (and features, where
appropriate), and a *decoder* responsible for predicting the target sequence
using the representation generated by the encoders. The encoders and decoder are
themselves Torch modules.

The model is responsible for constructing the encoders and decoders. The model
dictates the type of decoder. The model communicates with its modules by calling
them as functions (which invokes their `forward` methods); however, in some
cases it is also necessary for the model to call ancillary members or methods of
its modules.

When features are present, models are responsible for fusing source and features
encodings, and do so in a model-specific fashion. For example, ordinary RNNs and
transformers concatenate source and features encodings on the length dimension
(and thus require that the encodings be the same size), whereas hard attention
and transducer models average across the features encoding across the length
dimension and the concatenate the resulting tensor with the source encoding on
the encoding dimension; by doing so they preserve the source length and make it
impossible to attend directly to features symbols.

#### Decoding strategies

Each model supports greedy decoding implemented via a `greedy_decode` method;
some also support beam decoding via `beam_decode`
(cf.Â [#17](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/yoyodyne/issues/17)).

Some models (e.g., the hard attention models) require teacher forcing, but
others can be trained with either student or teacher forcing
(cf.Â [#77](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/yoyodyne/issues/77)).

### Testing

The "units" of [`tests/yoyodyne_test.py`](tests/yoyodyne_test.py) are
essentially small integration tests running through training, prediction, and
evaluation.

There are two kinds of data sets here. "Toy" data sets consist of simple
transductions over a small alphabet:

-   `copy` (i.e., repeat the input string twice)
-   `identity`
-   `reverse`
-   `upper` (i.e., map to uppercase)

These are configured to train for 20 epochs, training for no more than 2
minutes.

In contrast, the two "real" data sets target existing problems:

-   `ice_g2p`: Icelandic G2P data from the [2021 SIGMORPHON shared
    task](https://aclanthology.org/2021.sigmorphon-1.13/)
-   `tur_inflection`: Turkish inflection generation data from the
    [CoNLl-SIGMORPHON 2017 shared task](https://aclanthology.org/K17-2001/)

These are instead configured to train for up to 50 epochs (with early stopping),
training for no more than 10 minutes.

There are also a few tests which confirm that specific misconfigurations raise
exceptions.

To run all tests, run the following:

    pytest -vvv tests

Given this large number of units and the allotted amount of training time, which
accounts for the vast majority of compute time, running the full set of tests
could take as long as a few hours. Thus one may wish instead to specify a subset
of tests using the `-k` flag. For example, to run all the "toy" tests, run the
following:

    pytest -vvv -k toy tests

Or, to just run the Icelandic G2P tests, run the following:

    pytest -vvv -k g2p tests

Or, to just run the misconfiguration tests, run the following:

    pytest -vvv -k misconfiguration tests

See [the `pytest`
documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/usage.html) for more
information on the test runner.

### Releasing

1.  Create a new branch. E.g., if you want to call this branch "release":
    `git checkout -b release`
2.  Sync your fork's branch to the upstream master branch. E.g., if the upstream
    remote is called "upstream": `git pull upstream master`
3.  Increment the version field in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).
4.  Stage your changes: `git add pyproject.toml`.
5.  Commit your changes: `git commit -m "your commit message here"`
6.  Push your changes. E.g., if your branch is called "release":
    `git push origin release`
7.  Submit a PR for your release and wait for it to be merged into `master`.
8.  Tag the `master` branch's last commit. The tag should begin with `v`; e.g.,
    if the new version is 3.1.4, the tag should be `v3.1.4`. This can be done:
    -   on GitHub itself: click the "Releases" or "Create a new release" link on
        the right-hand side of the Yoyodyne GitHub page) and follow the
        dialogues.
    -   from the command-line using `git tag`.
9.  Build the new release: `python -m build`
10. Upload the result to PyPI: `twine upload dist/*`
